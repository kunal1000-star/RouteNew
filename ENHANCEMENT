3. **Performance Insights** - Data-driven analysis of study patterns
4. **Performance Analysis** - Comprehensive study performance reviews
5. **Personalized Recommendations** - Customized study suggestions based on learning style

### Technical Infrastructure:
- **AI Service Layer** (`src/lib/ai/ai-suggestions.ts`) - Core suggestion generation logic
- **Database Schema** (`migration-2025-11-04-ai-suggestions.sql`) - Complete database structure
- **API Endpoints** (`src/app/api/suggestions/route.ts`) - REST API for suggestion management
- **UI Components** - Beautiful suggestion cards and dashboard interface

### User Interface:
